## About Me

Greetings! I'm DanteDi, currently subjecting myself to vocational training as an IT Specialist for Application Development. My passions include diving headfirst into code, getting pleasantly lost in open-source projects, and constantly striving to learn new technologies. While my C#, JavaScript, and Python skills are still very much in their "awkward teenage phase," I've bravely decided to view every error as a golden opportunity... usually for more debugging.

## 🔭 What I'm currently building (or, more accurately, repeatedly breaking and then fixing):

- 💻 **WebServer:** A flexible, efficient, and hopefully robust WebServer, meticulously optimized for high traffic loads and promising response times so fast, they might actually outrun my own deadlines.
- 🤖 **DiscordBot:** Unleashing a highly customizable Discord bot upon the unsuspecting masses, capable of everything from maintaining digital order (moderation) to providing chaotic entertainment.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

My entire learning process is essentially an elaborate loop of "Oops, that's a bug!" followed by "Aha! Now I know what *not* to do." It's a surprisingly effective, albeit humbling, path to daily growth and continuous improvement!
